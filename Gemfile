# If you're using GitHub Pages, it's common to use the github-pages gem
# which manages Jekyll and its dependencies to match GitHub Pages environment.
# If deploying to GitHub Pages, you might prefer this group:
# group :jekyll_plugins do
#   gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
# end
# However, for your specific plugin list, explicitly listing them is also fine.
# The README for the theme used 'bundle install' and 'bundle exec jekyll serve' directly,
# implying a direct jekyll setup rather than relying solely on github-pages gem for local builds.
